## About Wave Theory

Wave Theory introduces a bold new vision of the universe—where time, gravity, quantum phenomena, and cosmic expansion all emerge from a single principle: the dynamics of wave geometry in a curved energy medium.

Wave Theory stands on three unwavering foundations:
● Every equation must emerge from first principles.
● Every prediction must match observation.
● No result is ever fine-tuned.

Any contributions to Wave Theory must adhere to above principles.

**Wave Theory** is an ongoing project to realign physics with its geometric roots — not by postulation, but by derivation.
